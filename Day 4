Class: TaxiDataLoader
Method: load_data() → returns a list of dictionaries or pandas DataFrame
Input: CSV or manually create a small dataset
Stage 2 — Data Cleaner
Class: TaxiDataCleaner
Method: clean_data(data) → remove trips with fare_amount <= 0 or passenger_count <= 0
Stage 3 — Feature Engineer
Class: TaxiFeatureEngineer
Method: add_features(data) → add a column fare_per_passenger = fare_amount / passenger_count
Stage 4 — Analyzer
Class: TaxiAnalyzer
Method: summary(data) → prints:
Total trips
Average fare
Max fare per passenger
